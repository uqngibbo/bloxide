Condition development for the ablation sim project.

 - We need something of about the same reynolds number as our BLLES papers, except really, really hot so that the surface has some temperature to it.
 - A scramjet combustor enthalpy is probably good enough, even if the HT is lower than a blunt body stagnation point
 - Steven suggests carbon phenonlic is a reasonable material and it should have some interesting chemistry coming out of the wall

Variables:
  - Freestream Mach Number
  - Freestream temperature and pressure
  - Boundary Layer Thickness
  - Wall Temperature
